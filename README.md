Pathogen pursuit was first created for the Science Play Corner at the 2024 ESCMID conference. I created it with the goal of making learning about antibiotic resistance fun and interesting, and helping to teach concepts such as the movement of antibiotic resistance genes between different bacterial species.

The game is still a prototype, and I only have a small number of physical copies which I make with my XTool computer-guided laser. To make the game more accessible, I've created a printable version of the game. The game materials should be printed on heavy cardstock, or cut out and pasted to heavy cardstock or paperboard.

**To get started, you'll need to print out the game board and pieces:**

* [Board and Pieces](https://github.com/genomicepi/pathogenpursuit/blob/main/Game%20Board%20and%20Pieces/Pathogen_Pursuit_Board_and_Tokens.pdf)
* [Cards](https://github.com/genomicepi/pathogenpursuit/blob/main/Game%20Board%20and%20Pieces/Pathogen_Pursuit_Cards.pdf)

You'll also need to print out notes sheets, they print out two per page, and each player will need one
* [Player notes sheets](https://github.com/genomicepi/pathogenpursuit/blob/main/Game%20Board%20and%20Pieces/Pathogen_Pursuit_Chart_Notes.pdf)

Don't forget to print out the instructions!

If you play the game, I'd love to get your feedback! You can submit feedback through Github, or through my [feedback link](https://airtable.com/appIcx3JTI2b0QQuc/shr71unlJelpMvx0h)
